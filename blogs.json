It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel. Here are some key points about\u00a0Git:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Version Control: Git tracks changes in files and directories, enabling multiple developers to collaborate on projects concurrently without overwriting each other's\u00a0work.</li>\n<li>Distributed: Every developer has a local copy of the entire repository, including its full history. This allows for offline work and faster access to version\u00a0history.</li>\n<li>Branching and Merging: Git uses branching extensively. Developers can create separate branches to work on features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Merging allows changes from one branch to be incorporated into\u00a0another.</li>\n<li>Commit: A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier, a commit message describing the changes made, and references to parent\u00a0commits.</li>\n<li>Repository: A Git repository is a collection of files and directories managed by Git. It contains the entire history of the project, including all branches and\u00a0commits.</li>\n<li>Remote Repositories: Git allows developers to synchronize their local repositories with remote repositories hosted on servers. This facilitates collaboration and\u00a0backup.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>GitHub:</h3>\n<p>GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It adds a layer of functionality on top of Git, providing features for collaboration, code review, and project management. Here's an overview of GitHub's features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Repository Hosting: GitHub hosts Git repositories in the cloud, making it easy for developers to share and collaborate on projects. Each repository has its own URL and can be accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions.</li>\n<li>Issue Tracking: GitHub provides a built-in issue-tracking system that allows developers to report bugs, request features, and discuss ideas. Issues can be assigned to specific team members, labeled, and organized into milestones.</li>\n<li>Pull Requests: A pull request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another. It allows for code review and discussion before changes are incorporated into the main codebase.</li>\n<li>Code Review: GitHub provides tools for conducting code reviews, including inline comments, different views, and the ability to approve or request changes to a pull\u00a0request.</li>\n<li>Collaboration: GitHub enables collaboration among developers through features like project boards, wikis, and discussions. Teams can work together to plan and track work, document processes, and share knowledge.</li>\n<li>Integration: GitHub integrates with a wide range of third-party services and tools, including continuous integration (CI) systems, code analysis tools, and project management platforms.</li>\n<li>Community and Open Source: GitHub hosts millions of open-source projects and has a large and active community of developers. It provides tools and resources for fostering collaboration and contributing to open-source software.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to track changes and collaborate on projects, while GitHub provides a platform for hosting Git repositories and facilitating collaboration, code review, and project management. Together, they form the backbone of modern software development workflows.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=98155f3c0f85\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JOgexQsWBdwu8J9LQRjzYw.png\"></figure><h3>Git:</h3>\n<p>Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
